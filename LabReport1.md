# `cd` Command Examples
1. ![cd-no-arguments](https://github.com/brooke-tru/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/146862163/b8e273cf-da58-4594-85f6-cd6f59dae214)
  The resulting working directory is the home directory after the cd command was run with no arguments. That's because `cd`, which stands for change directory, without any arguments won't do anything because we were basically telling the computer that we don't want any change. This result is no error because we asked the computer to change the directory without any direction, so it did not change from the home directory that it was in. I was able to double check that I was in the home directory by using the pwd command.
2. ![cd-to-directory](https://github.com/brooke-tru/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/146862163/9692c35b-0ec6-4671-b665-4720ee5772c6)
  I called the cd command with a path to my lecture1 directory. Before the command was run, I was in the home directory, but after running it with lecture1 as an argument, it changed the directory to lecture1. I got this output beacause the command to change directory with the argument lecture1 changed my directory from home to lecture1. I was able to check this by using the pwd command.
